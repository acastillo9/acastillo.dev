    Front End Developer

  <p class="text-text-light dark:text-text text-center">
    I'm a passionate Front End Developer with a special love for JavaScript and
    Web Development. I'm driven by creating seamless, user-focused interfaces,
    and I've honed my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and various modern
    frameworks. I believe that learning is an ongoing process, and sharing
    knowledge is integral to growth. I actively participate in tech communities,
    write blogs, and mentor upcoming coders. Always excited to connect, learn,
    and create the next big thing in web development!
